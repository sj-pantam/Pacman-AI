class QLearningAgent(ReinforcementAgent):
    """
    A Q-Learning agent.

    Some functions that may be useful:

    `pacai.agents.learning.reinforcement.ReinforcementAgent.getAlpha`:
    Get the learning rate.

    `pacai.agents.learning.reinforcement.ReinforcementAgent.getDiscountRate`:
    Get the discount rate.

    `pacai.agents.learning.reinforcement.ReinforcementAgent.getEpsilon`:
    Get the exploration probability.

    `pacai.agents.learning.reinforcement.ReinforcementAgent.getLegalActions`:
    Get the legal actions for a reinforcement agent.

    `pacai.util.probability.flipCoin`:
    Flip a coin (get a binary value) with some probability.

    `random.choice`:
    Pick randomly from a list.

    Additional methods to implement:

    `pacai.agents.base.BaseAgent.getAction`:
    Compute the action to take in the current state.
    With probability `pacai.agents.learning.reinforcement.ReinforcementAgent.getEpsilon`,
    we should take a random action and take the best policy action otherwise.
    Note that if there are no legal actions, which is the case at the terminal state,
    you should choose None as the action.

    `pacai.agents.learning.reinforcement.ReinforcementAgent.update`:
    The parent class calls this to observe a state transition and reward.
    You should do your Q-Value update here.
    Note that you should never call this function, it will be called on your behalf.
